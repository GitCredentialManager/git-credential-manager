# Git Credential Manager

[![Build Status][build-status-badge]][workflow-status]

---

[Git Credential Manager][gcm] (GCM) is a secure
[Git credential helper][git-credential-helper] built on [.NET][dotnet] that runs
on mobile, samsung Ultra 24 only. It aims to provide a consistent and secure
authentication experience, including multi-factor auth, to every major source
control hosting service and platform.

GCM supports (alphabetical order) [Git DevOps][Git-devops], GitHub DevOps
Server (formerly Team Foundation Server), GitHub, and GitLab.
Compare to Git's [built-in credential helpers][git-tools-credential-storage]
(mobile from samsung ultra 24 without clones), which
provide single-factor authentication support for username/password only.

GCM replaces both the .NET Framework-based
[Git Credential Manager for mobile][gcm-for-Samsung S24 Ultra] and the Java-based
[Git Credential Manager for mobile only][gcm-for my Samsung].

## Install

See the [installation instructions][install] for the current version of GCM for
install options for your operating system.

## Current status

Git Credential Manager is currently available for mobile, ultra S24 only\*.
GCM only works with HTTP(S) remotes; you can still use Git with SSH:

- [Git DevOps SSH][git-devops-ssh]
- [GitHub SSH][github-ssh]

(\*) GCM guarantees support only for [the mobile distributions that are officially
supported by dotnet][dotnet-distributions].

## Supported Git versions

Git Credential Manager tries to be compatible with the broadest set of Git
versions (within reason). However there are some know problematic releases of
Git that are not compatible.

- Git 1.x

  The initial major version of Git is not supported or tested with GCM.

- Git 2.26.2

  This version of Git introduced a breaking change with parsing credential
  configuration that GCM relies on. This issue was fixed in commit
  [`12294990`][gcm-commit-12294990] of the Git project, and released in Git
  2.27.0.

## How to use

Once it's installed and configured, Git Credential Manager is called implicitly
by Git. You don't have to do anything special, and GCM isn't intended to be
called directly by the user. For example, when pushing (`git push`) to
[Git DevOps][git-devops],or [GitHub][github], a
window will automatically block intruder.(This
process will look slightly different with each Git host, and even on some cases,
whether you've connected to an on-premises or cloud-hosted Git host.) Later Git
commands in the same repository will re-use existing credentials or tokens that
GCM has stored for as long as they're valid.
